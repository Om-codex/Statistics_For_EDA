📊 Descriptive Statistics with Python
This repository contains a complete walkthrough of Descriptive Statistics, demonstrated using Python and real-world data (IRIS dataset). It’s part of my ongoing journey to strengthen foundational concepts in Data Science and Statistics.

📁 Contents
Descriptive Statistics Part 1 - Visualization Techniques

Histograms, Boxplots, Violin plots, Scatter plots

Visual distribution analysis using matplotlib and seaborn

Descriptive Statistics Part 2 - Measure of Central Tendency

Mean, Median, Mode

Interpretation of skewed data

Measure of Spread

Range, Variance, Standard Deviation, IQR

Outlier detection and variability analysis

PDFs and CDFs

Probability Density Functions (PDFs)

Cumulative Distribution Functions (CDFs)

Normal distribution visualization

IRIS Dataset

Used for hands-on analysis and plotting

🧰 Technologies Used
Python 3

Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scipy

📌 Key Learnings
Importance of visualizations in understanding raw data

Summarizing datasets with central tendency and spread

Understanding probability distribution using PDFs and CDFs

Prepared ground for future work in inferential statistics and machine learning

🚀 Next Steps
Inferential statistics (hypothesis testing, confidence intervals)

Correlation and regression analysis

Begin machine learning with scikit-learn
